## Installation
### Requirements
Administrator permissions.
Internet access, preferrably uninterupted.

### Suggestions
An activated copy of Windows 11, still works on 10.
8GB RAM.
Use the "Beta" insider channel or the other builds as you prefer.
Remove Edge by some other community made script and use Edge Canary.

Search for "Terminal", press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to launch with admin rights. Use the Terminal UWP app, which has tabs.
You will get a UAC prompt, click yes.
Paste the text below into the newly launched window, assuming your shell is powershell. Copy it with the button in the top right corner.

```
Set-Location "$Env:windir\\Temp\\"
Remove-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -Recurse -Force
New-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -ItemType Directory -Force
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

```
You may be prompted for an input by powershell incase if it is the first time you are running a powershell script on Windows.
In that case, type letter "a" and enter.

Now open a new tab in terminal and paste this. The reason being that you need a new instance of powershell to recognize Git has been installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-NT.git $Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\
Set-Location "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\"
Start-Process powershell -ArgumentList "-NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -File `"$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\script\\main.ps1`"" -Verb RunAs

```
Now you should have started the execution of the script.
The first phase asks for manual interaction, and then it begins to perform common optimizations in an unattended manner.
Even though interaction will not be required later, you should still monitor its actions. Getting errors? Some are expected to occur.
