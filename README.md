## Installation

Pin Terminal to taskbar, press Ctrl+Shift and click the pinned icon.
This is the terminal UWP app, not powershell directly.
Paste the text below into the newly launched window, assuming your shell is powershell.

```
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine
Remove-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -Recurse -Force
New-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -ItemType Directory -Force
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget
git clone https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-NT.git $Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\"
powershell "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\script\\main.ps1"

```
You may be prompted for an input by powershell incase if it is the first time you are running a powershell script on Windows.
In that case, type letter "a" and enter.
