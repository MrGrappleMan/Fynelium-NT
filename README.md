## Installation
### Suggestions
An activated copy of Windows 11, still works on 10.
8GB RAM
Use the "Release Preview" insider channel or the other builds as you prefer

### Requirements
Administrator permissions
Internet access, preferrably uninterupted

Search for "Terminal", press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to launch in elevated mode. Use the Terminal UWP app, which has tabs.
You will get a UAC prompt, click yes
Paste the text below into the newly launched window, assuming your shell is powershell. Copy it with the button in the top right corner.

```
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine
Remove-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -Recurse -Force
New-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -ItemType Directory -Force
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

```
You may be prompted for an input by powershell incase if it is the first time you are running a powershell script on Windows.
In that case, type letter "a" and enter.

Now open a new tab in terminal and paste this. The reason being that you need a new instance of powershell to recognize Git has been installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-NT.git $Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\"
powershell "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\script\\main.ps1"

```
Now you should have started the execution of the script.
The first phase asks for manual interaction, and then it begins to perform common optimizations unattended.
Even though interaction will not be required later, you should still monitor it. See any error? Some are expected to occur
