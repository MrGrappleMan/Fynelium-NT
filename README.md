## Installation

Be sure to be connect to the internet and have administrator permissions
Pin Terminal to taskbar, hold Ctrl+Shift and click the app. Use the Terminal UWP app, not powershell directly. It needs to have tabs.
You will get a prompt, click yes
Paste the text below into the newly launched window, assuming your shell is powershell. I recommend copying it with the button in the top right corner.

```
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\"
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope LocalMachine
Remove-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -Recurse -Force
New-Item -Path "$env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\" -ItemType Directory -Force
winget install --id Git.Git -e --source winget

```
You may be prompted for an input by powershell incase if it is the first time you are running a powershell script on Windows.
In that case, type letter "a" and enter.

Now open a new tab in terminal and paste this. The reason being that you need a new instance of powershell to recognize Git has been installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/MrGrappleMan/Fynelium-NT.git $Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\
cd "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\"
powershell "$Env:windir\\Temp\\Fynelium-NT\\script\\main.ps1"

```
